# Assorted Bahraini Arabic


## Introduction 

Since I've been living in Bahrain I've been trying to pick up some of the local dialect of Arabic, which is quite different to those with which I was previously familiar.

The dialect has a large number of quirks which distinguish it from those spoken by other Arabs, perhaps the result of the multitude of different cultures who have travelled through or settled here over centuries.

Some of these entries may or may not be exclusive to Bahrain.

The country is culturally and linguistically similar to other gulf countries, in particular Kuwait for some reason, so these words and phrases may not necessarily be unique to Bahrain.

This article will be a somewhat stream of consciousness collection of tidbits I've learned here and there, which I will update periodically.



## سِيدَا

The word `سيدا` means `in front` or `forward`.

It is akin to `قدام` in other dialects.

Apparently it originates with Hindi or something.



## كَشْخَة

I gather that this is like fancy or refined but I'm not 100% certain.



## اِستِكَانِة

This one has a verrrrry interesting backstory, although I'm not sure how much I believe it.

Apparently it originates in the days of British rule in Bahrain when it was common for people to drink imported cans of iced tea.

Then over time the term `ice tea can` became more and more general in its usage and adopted as a word for a vessel from which one would drink.

So now `استكانة ساي` carries the same meaning as `كاسة شاي`.

I believe Iraq has something similar with their word for rice, but I can't recall the details.

Anyway, it's a good story, but I'm somewhat skeptical.



## تو

In formal Arabic the word `تو` literally means now.

Typically it's used in combination with `لل`, to form `للتو` meaning `just now`.

In the Bahraini dialect we drop the definite article and instead give possession of the now to a person.

For example you might say `توني رجعت`, I just got back, or more literally `my now got back`;

### تو الناس

There's a slight variation of this used to complain that something is happening too early.

I'm not even sure how it comes about, but it's something like too early for the people.

Sometimes with عامية it's a good idea not to overthink things.



## أجگّر

A word meaning `أدخّن`, derrived by slightly corrupting the word سيجارة.
