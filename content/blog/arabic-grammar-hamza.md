# Arabic Grammar Hamza


In Arabic there's this symbol that's sometimes regarded as a letter, sometimes not, called a hamza `ء`.

The sound that characterises the hamza is known as a glottal stop, which might be most accurately described as an intentional stutter or perhaps like the effect of seeing a donkey walking upright in the middle of saying a word.

It has a slight resemblance to the letter ayn (ع), as though someone were writing it with an Argos pen and then stopped half way through.

Most informal dialects don't even pronounce it at all, to make speech flow more easily, so `تَأكُل` becomes `تَاكُل`.

Surprisingly for a letter whose pronunciation is subtle, when it is even pronounced, it has a large amount of quite complicated grammar governing its usage.

Anecdotally, a lecturer at university once told us that "most Arabs" don't completely understand the correct usage of the hamza, which could be an exaggeration but it illustrates how complex this area is.



## Hierarchy of Vowels

Not only can a hamza appear in isolation (`ء`), it can also be appended to vowels.

Like many things in Arabic, this behavior will vary depending on where the hamza appears in the word.


____
### 1. At the beginning

If a hamza occurs at the beginning of a word it it must be on an alif.

No ifs, buts or maybes, the hamza will be on an alif whether it likes it or not.


**أَكْتُبُ**

**أُصُول**

**إِدْخَال**



___
### 2. In the middle

Here's where things get a bit more complicated.


___
### 3. At the end
